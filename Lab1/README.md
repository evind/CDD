## Runnable Class

To compile:

`[Lab1/]$: javac com/itcarlow/runnabletest/*.java`

To run:

`[Lab1/]$: java com.itcarlow.runnabletest.TestThread`

To generate JavaDoc:

`[Lab1/]$: javadoc -private -d javadoc/ com.itcarlow.runnabletest`

Note: JavaDoc does not show details of `RunnableDemo.java` by default because the class is not specified as `public`. Solution is to set the class as public or include the `-private` option to the `javadoc` command.

## Thread Class

To compile:

`[Lab1/]$: javac com/itcarlow/extendthread/*.java`

To run:

`[Lab1/]$: java com.itcarlow.extendthread.TestThread`
